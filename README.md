# CMP720 Embedded System Design – Spring 2026

This repository will be used for **all lab materials, templates, and supporting resources** for the **CMP720 Embedded System Design** course.

The aim of this repository is to provide students with a **structured, reproducible, and well-documented workspace** for hands-on embedded systems development throughout the semester.

---

## 📚 Course Overview

CMP720 focuses on the **design, implementation, analysis, and optimization of embedded systems**, integrating **hardware architecture, system software, and real-time constraints** with a strong emphasis on **research-driven design and validation**.

The course combines **theoretical foundations**, **hands-on practice**, and a **semester-long research project**, guiding students from system specification to evaluation and optimization.

Throughout the semester, students will study and apply the following topics in alignment with the course schedule:

- Fundamentals of embedded systems design and current research directions  
- System specifications, modeling, and requirements engineering  
- Embedded hardware platforms and system architectures  
- Sensor and actuator interfacing, timing constraints, and device drivers  
- System software concepts, including RTOS, scheduling, and real-time properties  
- Evaluation, validation, and testing methodologies for embedded systems  
- Optimization techniques for performance, timing, and resource efficiency  
- Hands-on optimization practices through iterative implementation and analysis  
- Research methodology, literature review, and technical reporting  
- Midterm and final project presentations demonstrating end-to-end system design

A significant component of CMP720 is the **final project**, which is developed incrementally through:
- topic proposal and group formation,
- literature review and methodology planning,
- midterm progress presentations,
- and a final report and presentation.

This structure ensures that students gain both **practical engineering skills** and **research-oriented experience** in embedded system design.
